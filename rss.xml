            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Colorado's Woody Creek Distillers</h1><p>Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze assembling in the States.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Design Indaba 2016: Interview With Jaime Hayon</h1><p>It's four o'clock in the morning and Jaime Hayon is still going full speed, sitting on a couch in Cape Town, candidly telling us about the time he tattooed one of the world's top tattoo artists. Had he ever inked somebody before? Nope, and he never did again.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/48f86a6be147d551b27ad334ff404c5fb1ce9b36.jpg"></article>]]></description>
